# DandD5e

You were hired by restaurant to create a solution for their drinks menu.

** I have completed the drink info app by following along with the tutorial and am now creating a variation for practice.

Their drinks menu is provided by an external company. All the data about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.

** I am using the open5e.com API to provide references to the D&D 5e ruleset.

Your job is to create a system that allows the restaurant employee to pull data from any drink in the database.

** The user will be able to pull information about D&D topics from the database.

You don't need SQL here, as you won't be operating the database. All you need is to create an user-friendly way to present the data to the users
(the restaurant employees)

** I will be using ConsoleTableExt by Hung Vo NuGet package to present the data to the user.

When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category. Then they'll have 
the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.

** The user will be presented with the Manifest page and then can choose a topic, at that point they can get more information about the topic.
